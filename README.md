# ravenous
Ravenous uses the Yelp API and the React Library to find businesses, services, and resteraunts around you. This was made so I could get familiar with React.

## How to use
[Live Version](https://codingforkids.us/projects/joesprojects/ravenous/) Pick a location, a type of service, and a way to sort results and hit Lets go! My favorite way to use it is by putting in my current location and then looking for FastFood, and selecting best match.
